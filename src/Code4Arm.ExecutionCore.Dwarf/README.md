# DWARF utilities

This project provides types used for parsing DWARF data from ELF executables and converting between source file lines and addresses in the executable.

Most code used here was borrowed from the [SharpDebug](https://github.com/southpolenator/SharpDebug) project (revision [0a19533](https://github.com/southpolenator/SharpDebug/commit/0a195334d46a318c2bcb68ff743b82bbff8ecf47)) and pruned extensively to only provide functionality required by the Code4Arm project.

The original project is licensed under the MIT license as stated below.
